# Dynamic-GUI-scripts
Created for Sys Admin to lend out scripts to junior admins

 This form is created for a hub for jr admins to utilize up to date scripting from sr admins. When a new script is added to the share drive/or local, the gui will auto update within a minute.
 
 Look for :	Fileshare = "" #Sanitized# and Agentdir = "" #Sanitized#  to add your customized locations.
 
 #Sanitized# is a place holder for what specifically you are searching for in your clipboard and corporate locations. 
 
 Comments are throughout the form to breakdown each function and it's purpose.
